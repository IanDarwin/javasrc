 * Statics -- class to show how static (class) variables work.
 *
 * We try to keep a useCount variable, but this code will show
 * that freed objects are not necessarily reclaimed immediately,
 * so useCount will in some circumstances show a higher number of nodes 
 * than is actually allocated. To fix this for a real program, you need
 * only move the "gc()" and "sleep()" calls into getCount(),
 * since that's when it's needed. Or, better yet,
 * change finalize() to close() and call it explicitly
 * when done with a given object.
