CLASSPATH PROBLEM

You do not appear to have the jakarta.mail package in your CLASSPATH.

You will need to download and install this file in order to compile 
the programs in `pwd`. Either get and install the javamail and
javax.activation APIs from http://java.sun.com/products/javamail,
or get and install the J2EE reference implementation (or another
J2EE implementation); all J2EE implementations include JavaMail.
