= Sample Gradle Project

This project was initially created with 'gradle init' as shown below.
I added one dependency and might've tweaked a file or two.
I did remove the gradlew files and the jar file, since my operating system
provides an installable gradle program.
However, this is basically what was created from the following:

----
$ doas pkg_add -v gradle
gradle-8.3v0: ok
$ mkdir gradledemo
$ cd gradledemo
$ gradle init

Welcome to Gradle 8.3!

Here are the highlights of this release:
 - Faster Java compilation
 - Reduced memory usage
 - Support for running on Java 20
