= incubation

This is a separate Maven/IDE project because use of incubation requires either a module-info,
or the JVM option, to add the particular incubation module.
Most of the rest of JavaSrc doesn't need these, so we keep incubation demos here.

This module consists of code samples for APIs that are in incubation (not Preview,
which are in the main module).
It may be empty at any particular time, since APIs in incubation come and go
and, importantly, files will move silently (except in the commitlog) out of here as it "graduates".
This README will not be updated; the code that graduates will simply move to main (usually)
or to another more appropriate project.
