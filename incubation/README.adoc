= incubation

This is a separate Maven/IDE project because use of incubation requires a module-info,
whereas most of the rest of JavaSrc doesn't need same and would find it a tad onerous to maintain.

It obviously consists of code samples for APIs that are in incubation.
It may be empty at any particular time, since APIs in incubation come and go.
This README will not be updated; the code that graduates will simply move to main (usually)
or to another more appropriate project.
