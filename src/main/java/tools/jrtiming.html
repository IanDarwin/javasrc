<h1>Timing Results</h1>
<p>Times for compiling and running a small self-contained test program,
where JVM startup time will dominate:
<h3>Jikes and Java (fastest)</h3>
<pre>
ian:504$ time ~/scripts/jr JrTest
+ jikes +E -d . JrTest.java
+ java JrTest
Class JrTest.clinit<>
SUCCESS! Program t compiled and run.
    0.53s real     0.25s user     0.15s system
</pre>

<h3>jr - not as fast, but still fast enough</h3>
<pre>
ian:506$ time ./jr JrTest
compileArgv len 1
filename == JrTest
runArgv len 0
Compile OK, trying to run
Class JrTest.clinit<>
SUCCESS! Program t compiled and run.
    1.53s real     0.98s user     0.17s system
ian:507$
</pre>

<h3>Ant (slower, since it has to parse an XML file)</h3>
<pre>
ian:524$ r ant
ant -f jrtest.xml
Buildfile: jrtest.xml

compile:

run:
     [java] Class JrTest.clinit<>
     [java] SUCCESS! Program t compiled and run.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds
ian:525$ time ant -f jrtest.xml
Buildfile: jrtest.xml

compile:

run:
     [java] Class JrTest.clinit<>
     [java] SUCCESS! Program t compiled and run.

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 2 seconds

<h3>javac and java (slowest, by far)</h3>
<pre>
ian:505$ time ~/scripts/jr -s JrTest
+ javac -d . JrTest.java
+ java JrTest
Class JrTest.clinit<>
SUCCESS! Program t compiled and run.
