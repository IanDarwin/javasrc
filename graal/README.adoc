= GraalVM Examples

Graal is a separate JVM from the standard JDK version of Java.
As such, not everything works the same!

The examples in this directory require use of GraalVM; they will probably not work
in a standard JVM or JDK!!

Note that with Java 21, the Graal team dropped the previous "gu"
installer in favor of using Maven/Gradle to add support for
polyglot languages (e.g., ruby, python). This project has been
updated; see the depenencies in the _pom.xml_ file.
For a more involved example, see https://github.com/graalvm/polglot-embedding-demo.
