This is a separate Maven/IDE project because use of incubation requires a module-info,
whereas most of the rest of JavaSrc doesn't need same and we would find it onerous to maintain.

This module consists of code samples for APIs that are in preview / incubation.
It may be empty at any particular time, since APIs in preview / incubation come and go.
This README will not be updated; the code that graduates will simply move to main (usually)
or to another more appropriate project.
