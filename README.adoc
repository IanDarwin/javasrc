= JavaCook Source Files (javasrc)

This is my assorted collection of (you guessed it) Java source.
It remains focused on building with
https://maven.apache.org/[Maven]
and the IDEs
https://eclipse.org/[Eclipse]
and
https://jetbrains.com/idea[IntelliJ IDEA].

== Origin

These files began as my personal collection of Java examples, back when Java was first unleashed on a 
public (well, developers) accustomed to having to choose between portability and performance.
I wrote a course for https://learningtree.com/[Learning Tree] and turned what I'd learned from
working with Java into the first edition of the
https://javacook.darwinsys.com/[Java Cookbook].
Now in its fourth edition, this book consists of several hundred how-to "recipes"
each discussing a particular problem that devs have to code, how to solve it, and 
illustrated with one or more code examples. The contents of the current edition looks like this:

// Uses * not + because of what's at the end of this list.

* 2 Interacting with the Environment

== Tech

*The minimum Java release is currently 21*. You can compile for Java 17 by checking out the java-17 branch.
Or you could just add exclusions for files that use newer features.
For older releases, I don't seem to have branches or tags, so if somebody can bisect and tell me what works for 11,
I shall be happy to add a tag.

A few files use Java 21 "Preview" features, so if you're not compiling with the Maven POM file provided,
and you're still using Java 21, you'll need the arguments `--enable-preview --source-21` to get these to compile.

As mentioned above, about a third of these files are featured in my O'Reilly
https://javacook.darwinsys.com/[Java Cookbook].
I use a script (+copyCodeSamples+) to pre-format these for inclusion in the O'Reilly publishing toolchain;
these will have `// tag::foo[]` and `// end::foo[]` comments to mark sections for
mechanical inclusion into the book. These are just comments to Java tooling
and can be completely ignored by people looking at the source code normally.
Not all files with these comments necessarily appear in the book;
files are included from the manuscript using 
https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor]'s `include` mechanism and,
when a code sample gets dropped from the book, I have no motivation
to edit the tags out of the code, in case I use it elsewhere.

== Structured as Maven Modules

This repo consists of about a dozen Maven modules (aka subdirectories :-)),
as follows:

* main - everything that isn't in one of the others
* desktop - GUI/Graphics, JavaFX, comm devices, etc.
* ee - Jakarta EE (Java EE, J2EE) stuff
* graal - Only works with graal vm
* jlink - Not ready yet?
* json - JSON parsing and formatting with various APIs
* lombokdemo - Project Lombok - not working ATM
* Rdemo-web - NOT a maven module - some R demos
* restdemo - REST
* spark - Apache SPARK
* unsafe - com.sun.Unsafe
* testing - code that shows more details on testing (other modules have normal unit tests)
* testing-spock - testing with the Spock framework
* unsafe - you shouldn't want to know
* xml - XML parsing and formatting with various APIs
* sidebyside - NOT a maven module - some non-Java versions of demos

A few modules are disabled because I don't have time to fix them now.

Prior to the Java Cookbook revision (late 2019/early 2020), 
this repo was one single module with no sub-modules. This became difficult
to manage and to use, since, to compile anything, a user would have to wait for Maven
to download all the dependencies and their dependencies and theirs... 
That revision seemed like a good time to split the whole shebang into smaller pieces.
Each module has its own POM file, Maven structure, etc.

A main reason was that the CLASSPATH was becoming unmanageable.
Not to mention MODULEPATH, and the time it takes to build the whole thing.
Right now there is a lot of stuff in the "main" module, but this will
get broken out into a few additional modules.

Now that it's done this way, you can choose to just build one module
or another, _without having Maven download 3/4 of the Internet_ for
dependencies. Just `cd` into one of the module directories and
invoke `mvn` there. Or you can do them all by invoking `mvn` in
the top-level directory. 

Useful mvn targets include `compile` and `test`.
Do not use `mvn package` as the jar files won't be useful on their own.

=== I broke it (but it's easy to fix)

Unfortunately for those who already had the original all-in-one _javasrc_
checked out and an Eclipse project created in that directory,
you should do the following:

* In Eclipse, delete javasrc project (do NOT check 'delete contents on disk'!);
* Delete the old target folder (*only*): {++rm -r++ or ++del/s++} __javasrc/target__;
* Do a "git pull" to rearrange the project and get the extra pom files;
* Back in Eclipse, ++File->New Java Project->browse to (but not into) workspace/javasrc/main++.
Set project name to ++javasrc-main++. 
If asked to upgrade the JDK release, say OK.
If asked to create a module-info, *click Do Not Create*.
Click ++OK/Finish++.
* You may want to create some or all of the other projects such as xml, jlink, spark, unsafe, ...
Do this same way as previous step: File->new Java project etc.
Recommmended names are javasrc-xml, javasrc-unsafe, etc.

The older 'javasrcee' repository was originally formed by splitting
it off from this repository, several years ago. Now, with this modularization,
it has been merged back in, as the `ee` module.

== No module-info

There are no module-info.java files in most of the subdirectories
because this is not meant to
be built and used as a library or even as a cohesive software base.
A few that need them for imports &c have them.

== Notes on Individual Modules

testing::
	Works under "mvn test". Compiles as an Eclipse project, but can't run due to
	a Junit 5 loading conflict (pull requests welcome on this one, thanks).

== Building

* You MUST HAVE a current release of Java (see notes at beginning) to successfully compile this whole package.
Sorry if you are on some relic platform that doesn't have current Java.
Even https://openbsd.org[OpenBSD] has Java 21 (Thanks Kurt!).
Also sorry if your organization is stuck on an ancient Java due to application server issues.

* I am using Eclipse for most of my development, and Maven for building, and Jenkins
for automated building. The Ant scripts have been removed (except for a few in the ee module
under _ejb2_ and _rmi_; the few that remain
will someday get deleted, or converted to Maven exec:java configurations).

* Building with Maven 3.x works and tests pass.

* Building with Eclipse tested with Eclipse 4.x; MUST HAVE "m2e" (free in the Eclipse Marketplace)
Compiles and tests pass.

* Building with other platforms? Good luck, but let me know if it works.
