= multijardemo

*N.B.* This is _not_ a Maven module. As such it does not
follow the usual Maven/Gradle directory structure.

It does demonstrate use of multi-release Jar files (mrj)
to use a `public class` on older Javas and a `public record`
on modern Java.

You have to have a script called `withjava`, or otherwise
arrange to `javac` the older versions with an older Java,
and run with that older version, in the places where my
`withjava` script is called from within the main `mkjar` script.

This could be a it more automated by use of `maven` or `gradle`,
but I wanted to show the individual steps.
